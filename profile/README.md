> **"Memory is the missing layer of modern AI."**


## 🚫 Problems We Solve

- ❌ Repeating the same information to AI over and over
- ❌ Losing organizational knowledge in Slack or Notion
- ❌ Wasting tokens on context bloating
- ❌ Having knowledge scattered across tools with no semantic filter


## 🚀 Our Vision

We believe:

- **Every team should have a shared AI-accessible memory.**
- **Agents should be able to think over time—not just over prompts.**
- **Knowledge should be dynamic, structured, and filtered automatically.**

## ❤️ Why We Care

Because every AI agent deserves a brain.  
Because every human should stop repeating themselves.  
Because knowledge is too precious to be forgotten—or wasted in a doc nobody reads.
